I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/), advised by [Tianyin Xu](https://tianyin.github.io/). My primary interests are in
improving the correctness and reliability of cloud software systems and infrastructure.

Previously, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2020 from Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked with [Greg Ganger](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/) and [Angela Jiang](https://angelajiang.carrd.co/) on ML systems and scheduling.

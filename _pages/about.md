I'm a Ph.D. student in the
[Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) at
[UIUC](https://illinois.edu/), advised by
[Daniel Kang](https://ddkang.github.io/). My primary interests are in
cryptography, especially zero-knowledge systems.

Previously, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2020 from Carnegie
Mellon University, where I worked with
[Greg Ganger](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/) and
[Angela Jiang](https://angelajiang.carrd.co/) on ML systems and scheduling.
